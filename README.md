#### About this file
This README.md file is written in Markdown syntax - here is a quick [intro](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).


### Ideas
#### 1 - tiktok data

* [ ] map of tiktok songs and which countries they trend in.
* [ ] rank of one interesting song over time, leaving a line behind
#### 2 - new trend extent
* [ ] limit to one dimension
* [ ] add hover, make all lines transparent, but then hover add color for line and song
* [ ] leave song label
