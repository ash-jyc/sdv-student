# Storytelling with Data Visualization ðŸ¦•

Hi! I am Ashley and this repository is dedicated to my work from the *Storytelling with Data Visualization* class. Our final project was developing a data journalism piece regarding the resurgence of decades old music in recent history. You can find our final piece [here](https://ash-jyc.github.io/sdv-student/coding-exercises/website).

### My work

For this class, I created intermediate visualizations in the [coding exercise](coding-exercises/) folder.

#### About this file
This README.md file is written in Markdown syntax - here is a quick [intro](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).


### Ideas
#### 1 - tiktok data

* [ ] map of tiktok songs and which countries they trend in.
* [ ] rank of one interesting song over time, leaving a line behind
* [ ] slow down time, maybe smth like a pause button
#### 2 - new trend extent
* [ ] limit to one dimension (remove rank)
* [ ] add hover, make all lines transparent, but then hover add color for line and song. (can add song label at bottom of the song)
* [X] leave song label
* [ ] filter out more songs
