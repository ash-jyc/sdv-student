- VS Code Extension: Live Server by Ritwick Dey
- [The giant CSV file from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated)

## Before you run the code
Move the CSV file to `lab6-inclass` folder.

## Run the code
Hypothetically, you should just be able to click the live server button, the one that says `Port: 5500` in the bottom right corner, and run the code.... You can type a 2 letter country code and it should output some dots. Then, you can hover to see basic information about the dot.
