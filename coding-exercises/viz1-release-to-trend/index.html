            <p>Music is a shared human experience, a thread that connects individuals and binds communities. It is a form of storytelling and expressing emotions, one that humans have been practicing for at least 35,000 years. Having such a vast history, it is natural for songs of the past to remain there, forgotten in time.</p>
            <p>
            Of course, occurrences such as holidays, new releases, and artist tours have always played a role in bringing songs into the charts. However, today's multimedia environment brings new opportunities for music to gain or regain popularity. From TV and movie appearances to rising TikTok trends, comebacks have become all the more achievable for songs of the past.

            <p>The songs “Murder on the Dancefloor,” by Sophie Ellis-Bextor and “Unwritten” by Natasha Bedingfield were both featured in films released in December 2023. After the release of “Murder on the Dancefloor” in 2001, the song charted for two years, then faded into the background. Similarly, “Unwritten” charted for two years after its release in 2004 before it was seemingly forgotten. Ellis-Bextor’s song was used in the final scene of the controversial film Saltburn, while Bedingfield’s was featured throughout the film Anyone But You. With the release of these films, the two artists’ songs have once again found themselves atop the charts roughly 20 years after their debut.</p>
