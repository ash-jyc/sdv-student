# For Eva so she can effectively get data
## Stuff to download
- VS Code Extension: Live Server by Ritwick Dey
- [The giant CSV file from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated)

## Before you run the code
Move the CSV file to `lab6-inclass` folder. Do not change the name.

## Run the code
Hypothetically, you should just be able to click the live server button, the one that says `Port: 5500` in the bottom right corner, and run the code.... You can type the name of the country into the box and submit and it should output data. If something's not showing up, just check the mapping inside the code.
